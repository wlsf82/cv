## Education
Bachelor in business management with an emphasis on system information analysis at PUCRS (2012)

## Professional experience

### Senior Software Engineer in Test at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) (March 2019 - current job)

Some of the activities I perform as a SET at GitLab are:

- Leading test automation implementation and guiding testing approaches for new feature development
- Identifying test gaps and prioritizing adding coverage based on areas of risk
- Providing input into testing the security and scalability of the product
- Leading development of new tooling and infrastructure
- Implementing new automation framework features with little guidance
- Recommending new test automation tools and processes that will improve quality and velocity
- Taking ownership of test failures and ensuring that the CI system is reliable
- Mentoring other engineers
- Independently and regularly managing project schedules ensuring objectives are aligned with team/department goals
- Working on problems of diverse scope requiring independent evaluation of identifiable factors; recommending new approaches to resolve problems
- At GitLab I work 100% remote

_Projects:_

- [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss)

- [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/)

_Stack:_ Selenium, Capybara, Rspec, Docker, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, VueJS, and GitLab.

### QA engineer at [Qelp](http://qelp.com) (July 2018 - February 2019)

I helped on defining a new software development process where quality is in mind since the definition of the software requirements until the moment it is running in production.

Some of the activities I performed as a QA engineer at Qelp were:

- Writing automated graphical user interface functional tests
- Writing automated acceptance tests
- Writing automated visual regression tests
- Defining and tunning continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment pipelines
- Code review
- Extending the application to add testability into it
- Writing business requirements together with the business analyst
- Pair programming
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Actively participating in software architecture meetings
- Actively participating in scrum meetings
- Debugging and fixing bugs
- Refactoring code

_Stack:_ AWS, NodeJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo, Cypress, Protractor, BackstopJS, SemaphoreCI, and Jenkins.

### Senior QA engineer at [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) (June 2016 - February 2018)

I helped the team creating end-to-end tests with the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework and visual regression tests with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) (for the web application), and UI tests with XCUI Test (for the iOS app). These tests were executed on CI/CD ([gocd](http://gocd.org)) for each pull request, providing fast feedback while changing the applications. I was also responsible for maintaining the CI/CD system and its infrastructure-as-code, with approximately 30 pipelines.

Every two months, I was the on-call engineer (available 24/7 in case of production incidents). In such cases, I'd have to deal with assessing the criticality of issues, accessing Linux servers for log analysis, working with monitoring tools like NewRelic, and Graphana to understand what was the issue and fixing it.

I used to work remotely very often.

_Projects:_

- [Whereby](https://whereby.com/)
- [Whereby (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whereby-video-meetings/id878583078)

### Software developer and agile testing coach at [Taller Digital Business](http://taller.net.br/en/) (June 2014 – May 2016)

At first, I was hired as a QA engineer to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format with Cucumber (in Ruby language).

After some time, I helped the company in a significant transformation, where software testing was not a phase during the software development process anymore, but part of it.

During this transformation, I changed my position to a software developer.

As a software developer, I helped the team develop features, fixing bugs, writing tests, and refactoring code.

At Taller, I also had the role of an agile testing coach. As so, I used to share knowledge about agile testing throughout all the company, and help the team on building a mindset where everyone is responsible for the quality of the developed software.

At this position, I worked firstly using Scrum, and then we evolved for using Kanban and continuous flow.

I used to work remotely occasionally.

_Stack:_ Drupal, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SASS, Protractor, Cucumber, Vagrant and, StriderCD.


### QA at [ADP](https://www.adp.com) (April 2011 – May 2014)

At APD, I worked in two different projects (both as a QA analyst).

In the first project, I developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium).

In the second project, I developed automated tests in VBScript (using HP Quick Test Pro).

At ADP, I had my first contact with agile methodologies, such as Scrum.

I was also the leader of an internal project called Tech Talks, used for internal knowledge sharing.

I used to work remotely occasionally.

_Stack:_ Java, VBScript, SQL, and Jenkins.

### Manual and automated test analyst at [Good Card](http://goodcard.com.br) (November 2009 - March 2011)

In this job, I had my first contact with test automation, having to make my manager understand that test automation is not about record and playback.

At Good Card, I started the creation of a test automation framework for web applications using JavaScript.

Part of my job was also creating unit tests for database triggers and procedures, creating and executing manual test cases, and managing bugs.

At this job, I also had a quick experience as a software developer, writing PL/SQL code.

_Projects:_

- [Eco Benefícios](https://www.ecobeneficios.com.br)
- [Eco Frotas](https://www.ecofrotas.com.br)
