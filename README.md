## Professional experience

### Online instructor and founder at [Talking About Testing school](https://www.udemy.com/user/walmyr/) (2018 - current job)

In 2018, I started an online school called Talking About Testing.

The school focuses on teaching test automation, offering more than ten courses.

Summing up the number of students on all platforms ([Coursify.me](https://talkingabouttesting.coursify.me/), [Hotmart](https://hotmart.com/pt-br/club/cypress-playground-ate-a-nuvem), and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/walmyr/)), I already have more than 25K students.

Now, I'm taking the school to the next level and making it my full-time job, where I recycle courses, launch new ones, and make other improvements here and there.

### Senior Quality Assistance Software Engineer at [Typeform](https://https://www.typeform.com) (March 2022 - January 2023)

At Typeform I:

- Helped teams with test automation tasks, especially with Cypress
- Ran Cypress Masterclasses
- Ran exploratory testing sessions
- Helped with visual regression testing-related tasks
- Refactored testing code
- Reviewed code
- Enabled teams to get better at quality and testing-related subjects

Some of my achievements at Typeform were:

- Cost reduction with Visual Regression Testing by replacing a costly SaaS with a cheap self-hosted open-source service

### Senior QA engineer at [QWIC](https://qwic.eu/)  (September 2020 - January 2021)

Some of the activities I performed at QWIC were:

- End-to-end testing with Puppeteer and Jest
- Migrating Puppeteer + Jest tests into Cypress tests
- Increasing the test coverage
- Component testing with Cypress
- Code reviews
- Refactoring
- Triaging of service desk issues
- Continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery
- Development of small features using React

Some of my achievements at QWIC were:

- Improvements in the test automation framework to allow for easy maintenance and readability
- Improvements on the git workflow to improve the overall team efficiency and productivity
- Process improvements using Kanban to allow for a steadier and predictable system
- Automatic version and security updates implementation using GitHub Dependabot
- Allowing to test the frontend independent of the backend using Cypress

### Software Consultant at [Taller Digital Business](https://taller.net.br/en/) (July 2020 - September 2020)

- Consulting in quality assurance subjects
- Workshops and training in testing automation topics
- 100% remote

### Senior Software Engineer in Test at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) (March 2019 - June 2020)

Some of the activities I performed as a SET at GitLab were:

- Leading test automation implementation and guiding testing approaches for new feature development
- Identifying test gaps and prioritizing adding coverage based on areas of risk
- Providing input on testing the security and scalability of the product
- Leading the development of new tooling and infrastructure
- Implementing new automation framework features with little guidance
- Recommending new test automation tools and processes that will improve quality and velocity
- Taking ownership of test failures and ensuring that the CI system is reliable
- Mentoring other engineers
- Independently and regularly managing project schedules, ensuring objectives are aligned with team/department goals
- Working on problems of diverse scope requiring independent evaluation of identifiable factors; recommending new approaches to resolve problems
- At GitLab, I worked 100% remotely

### QA engineer at [Qelp](https://qelp.com) (July 2018 - February 2019)

I helped define a new software development process that prioritizes quality from the initial definition of software requirements through to its deployment in production.

Some of the activities I performed as a QA engineer at Qelp were:

- Writing automated graphical user interface functional tests
- Writing automated acceptance tests
- Writing automated visual regression tests
- Defining and tuning continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment pipelines
- Code reviews
- Extending the application to add testability to it
- Writing business requirements together with the business analyst
- Pair programming
- Knowledge-sharing sessions
- Actively participating in software architecture meetings
- Actively participating in Scrum meetings
- Debugging and fixing bugs
- Refactoring code

### Senior QA engineer at [Whereby](https://whereby.com/) (June 2016 - February 2018)

I helped the team create end-to-end tests using the [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework and visual regression tests with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) (for the web application), as well as UI tests with XCUI Test (for the iOS app). These tests were executed on CI/CD ([gocd](https://gocd.org)) for each pull request, providing fast feedback while changing the applications. I was also responsible for maintaining the CI/CD system and its infrastructure-as-code, with approximately 30 pipelines.

Every two months, I was the on-call engineer (available 24/7 in case of production incidents). In such cases, I'd have to assess the criticality of issues, access Linux servers for log analysis, and work with monitoring tools like New Relic and Grafana to understand the issue and resolve it.

I used to work remotely very often.

### Software developer and agile testing coach at [Taller Digital Business](https://taller.net.br/en/) (June 2014 – May 2016)

Initially, I was hired as a QA engineer to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format using Cucumber (in Ruby).

After some time, I helped the company undergo a significant transformation, where software testing was no longer a phase during the software development process, but an integral part of it.

During this transformation, I transitioned into a software developer role.

As a software developer, I assisted the team in developing features, fixing bugs, writing tests, and refactoring code.

At Taller, I also had the role of an agile testing coach. As such, I used to share knowledge about agile testing throughout the company and help the team develop a mindset where everyone is responsible for the quality of the software they develop.

In this position, I initially worked using Scrum, and then we transitioned to using Kanban and continuous flow.

I used to work remotely occasionally.

### QA analyst at [ADP](https://www.adp.com) (April 2011 – May 2014)

At APD, I worked on two different projects (both as a QA analyst).

In the first project, I developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium).

In the second project, I developed automated tests in VBScript (using HP Quick Test Pro).

At ADP, I had my first exposure to agile methodologies, including Scrum.

I was also the leader of an internal project called Tech Talks, which was used for sharing internal knowledge.

I used to work remotely occasionally.

### Manual and automated test analyst at [Good Card](https://goodcard.com.br) (November 2009 - March 2011)

In this job, I had my first experience with test automation, having to convince my manager that test automation is not just about record and playback.

At Good Card, I initiated the development of a test automation framework for web applications utilizing JavaScript.

Part of my job also involved creating unit tests for database triggers and procedures, developing and executing manual test cases, and managing bugs.

At this job, I also gained some experience as a software developer, writing PL/SQL code.

### Other jobs as a tester/QA

Before moving into test automation (between 2004 and 2009), I worked as a manual tester at Hewlett-Packard, Sicredi, Softplan, Dell Computers, and Datum TI.
