# I'm open to new opportunities

I'm looking for a challenging opportunity as a **Quality Assurance Engineer**, **Software Engineer in Test (SET)**, or **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)**.

The ideal position would be in the **JavaScript/TypeScript** realm, using **React** in the frontend, **Node.js** in the backend, **Cypress** for test automation, and one of the following tools for continuous integration & delivery (**GitHub Actions**, **GoCD**, or **SemaphoreCI**).

Ideally, this position would be **100% remote**, allow for **flexible working hours** (let people work when they're productive), encourage **async communication**, and have a **headcount of not greater than 50 people**.
Also, it would be for **product development**.

The company must value **autonomy**, **open-source**, **test automation**, **clean code/architecture**, **refactoring**, **pair programming**, **code review**, **small iterations**, **knowledge sharing**, **transparency**, and a **culture of mentorship**.

If your company has a position that could be a good fit for my profile, I'd be happy to have a chat.

You can find my updated CV at **https://github.com/wlsf82/cv**.

Best regards,

Walmyr
