# I'm open to new opportunities

I'm looking for a challenging opportunity as a **QA Lead**, **Quality Assurance Software Engineer**, **Software Engineer in Test (SET)**, or **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)**.

The ideal position would be in the **JavaScript/TypeScript** realm, using **React** in the frontend, **Node.js** in the backend, **Cypress** for test automation, and one of the following tools for continuous integration and delivery (**GitHub Actions**, or **SemaphoreCI**).

Ideally, this position would be in the **product development** space, **100% remote**, allow for **flexible working hours** (let people work when they're productive), encourage **async communication**, and **the company's headcount should be at most 50 people**.

The company must value **autonomy**, **results over worked hours**, **open-source**, **test automation**, **clean code/architecture**, **refactoring**, **code review**, **small iterations**, and **transparency**.

If your company has a position that could be a good fit for my profile, I'd be happy to have a chat.

You can find my updated CV at **https://github.com/wlsf82/cv#walmyr-filho**.

Cheers,

Walmyr
