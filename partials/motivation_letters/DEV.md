# I'm open to new opportunities

I'm looking for a challenging opportunity as a **React developer**.

I've been working with software development focused on quality assurance for more than fifteen years, and I believe that experienced software teams don't need a person dedicated to QA because **the quality is everyone's responsibility**.

Due to this belief, I want to move to the **dev side of the force**. <(-_-)>

I have experience with **Node.js**, **React** and **React-Native**. I'm also **always** studying and practicing **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **GraphQL** on some side projects (listed at the end of this letter), and I'd love to continue working as a software developer from now on.

As a bonus, I can help with **end-to-end testing** and **visual regression testing**!

Ideally, the position would be **100% remote**.
Also, it would be for **product development**.

Finally, the company must value things such as **open-source**, **test automation**, **clean code**, **clean architecture**, **refactoring**, **pair programming**, **code review**, **small iterations**, **knowledge sharing**, and a **culture of mentorship**.

If your company has a position that could be a good fit for my profile, I'd be happy to have a chat.

You can find my updated CV on **https://github.com/wlsf82/cv**.
