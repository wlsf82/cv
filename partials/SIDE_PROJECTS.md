## YouTube channel: [Talking About Testing](https://www.youtube.com/talkingabouttesting)

This project is a YouTube channel with hands-on videos about test automation, group conversations, mentoring sessions, and career-related topics.

**Note:** The content is in Portuguese.

## Node module: [protractor-helper](http://npmjs.com/package/protractor-helper)

This project is a library with different methods that can be used together with Protractor for creating robust and flakiness-free end-to-end tests.

_Stack:_ Node.js

## [backstop-config](https://github.com/wlsf82/backstop-config)

This project has a simple implementation of BackstopJS tests that can be used by anyone who needs to run screenshot comparison tests in static web pages that have different URLs.

_Stack:_ Node.js

## Architecture proposal: [Protractor components and page objects](https://github.com/wlsf82/protractor-components-and-page-objects)

In this project, I demonstrate an architecture proposal for writing GUI tests with Protractor using a concept of components, to have stable, reliable, and maintainable end-to-end tests.

_Stack:_ Node.js

## [Mentoring](https://talkingabouttesting.com/mentoria-coaching/)

In this project, I mentor QAs in subjects related to test automation, agile testing, continuous integration, version control, DevOps, and career, to help them grow and be better professionals.
