**Note:** The above courses are only available in Portuguese.

## Book: [End-to-end testing with Protractor - Lessons learned about e2e test automation](https://leanpub.com/end-to-end-testing-with-protractor)

In this book, you will find a collection of practices to implement end-to-end test automation in the development process of web applications using the Protractor framework.

**Note:** This book is also available in Portuguese through the following [link](http://casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-protractor).

## YouTube channel: [Talking About Testing](https://www.youtube.com/talkingabouttesting)

This project is a YouTube channel with hands-on videos about test automation, group conversations, mentoring sessions, and career-related topics.

**Note:** The majority of the content is in Portuguese, but I've started an [English content playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QFCgBuHFSSJUeEYDm6wwvHI).

## [El Genio](https://github.com/wlsf82/el-genio)

El Genio is a powerful no-code testing platform that helps you create and run automated tests for your web applications without writing a single line of code.

## [GitLab-Cypress](https://github.com/wlsf82/gitlab-cypress)

A sample project to experiment with [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for testing a complex web application such as [GitLab](https://hub.docker.com/r/wlsf82/gitlab-ce). In the project, I share some of my ideas about testing design, best practices, optimizations, and more. This project could be used as a base for those willing to learn about web testing with Cypress.

## Node module: [@walmyr-filho/cy-press](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@walmyr-filho/cy-press)

A silly Cypress `.press()` command that simulates pressing a keyboard key.

## Node module: [protractor-helper](http://npmjs.com/package/protractor-helper)

This project is a library with different methods that can be used together with Protractor for creating robust and flakiness-free end-to-end tests.

## Visual regression testing with [backstop-config](https://github.com/wlsf82/backstop-config)

This project has a simple implementation of BackstopJS tests that can be used by anyone who needs to run screenshot comparison tests in static web pages that have different relative URLs.
