# I'm open to new opportunities

I'm looking for a challenging opportunity as a **React developer**.

I've been working with software development focused on quality assurance for more than fifteen years, and I believe that experienced software teams don't need a person dedicated to QA because **the quality is everyone's responsibility**.

Due to this belief, I want to move to the **dev side of the force**. <(-_-)>

I have a little experience with **React** and **React-Native** development. Still, I have also been studying and practicing **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **GraphQL** for quite a while on some side projects (listed at the end of this letter), and I'd love to continue working as a software developer from now on.

As a bonus, I can help with **end-to-end testing**!

Ideally, the position would be **100% remote**.
Also, it would be for **product development**.

Finally, the company must value things such as **test automation**, **clean code**, **refactoring**, **pair programming**, **code reviews**, **small iterations**, **knowledge sharing**, and a **culture of mentorship**.

If your company has a position that could be a good fit for my profile, I'd be happy to have a chat.

You can find my updated CV on **https://github.com/wlsf82/cv**.

And below, you can find the list of side-projects that I mentioned earlier.
